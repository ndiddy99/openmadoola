# OpenMadoola

Free software (GPL v2.0 or later) reimplementation of "The Wing of Madoola"

![OpenMadoola screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Usage

In order to function, OpenMadoola requires the font.bin, 2c04.pal, and nes.pal data files as well as the demo and mml directories from this repository. It also requires a Wing of Madoola ROM image. The ROM image can either be a standard NES ROM file named "madoola.nes" or the "sharedassets0.assets" file from [Sunsoft is Back! Retro Game Selection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821290/SUNSOFT_is_Back/) on Steam. OpenMadoola reads all the graphics and level data from the ROM image, and will refuse to start if it is not present.

If you don't have an original cartridge or don't want to deal with dumping it, I would recommend buying the collection on Steam rather than downloading a ROM off the internet. It's only $13 and has a nice interface with high-quality scans of the manual as well as some concept art. It also shows Sunsoft that there's interest in their legacy IP. To retrieve the "sharedassets0.assets" file, go to your Steam library, right click the Sunsoft collection, and click "Manage->Browse local files". It will be in the "SUNSOFT is Back! Retro Game Selection_Data" directory.

### UNIX-like platforms (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, etc)

OpenMadoola will attempt to read the ROM image and data files from these directories:

1. `~/.openmadoola`
2. `/usr/local/share/openmadoola`
3. `/usr/share/openmadoola`
4. Current working directory

It will also write configuration and save data to `~/.openmadoola`.

### Windows

OpenMadoola will attempt to read the ROM image and data files from the current working directory (typically the directory the executable is in). If it doesn't see a ROM image in the current working directory, it will also try reading from the default Steam install directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SUNSOFT is Back! レトロゲームセレクション). OpenMadoola will write configuration and save data to the current working directory.

### Default controls

Keyboard | Gamepad (xbox layout) | Equivalent NES button
-------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
W | D-Pad Up | D-Pad Up
S | D-Pad Down | D-Pad Down
A | D-Pad Left | D-Pad Left
D | D-Pad Right | D-Pad Right
J | X | B
K | A | A
Right Shift | Back | Select
Enter | Start | Start

You can change the controls in the options menu. Pressing A+B+Select+Start while in-game will exit to the title screen.

### Game types

Also in the options menu, you'll find a "game type" setting. The "Original" game type tries to simulate the original NES game but with important bugfixes, while the "Plus" game type (the default) includes additional fixes for more minor bugs as well as tweaks that I think improve the game. The "Arcade" game type is a recreation of the VS. System port.

#### Changes for all game types
- Game runs without NES hardware limitations (no slowdown, no sprite flicker, no garbage on the edge of the screen)
- Game progress is saved to disk
- Fixed a bug where collecting the Wing of Madoola and then entering a door would make Darutos not spawn
- Fixed a bug where killing Darutos and then dying to one of his fireballs would let you skip fighting him after continuing
- Fixed a bug where sound effects would sometimes get stuck on, glitch out, etc.
- Fixed a bug where pausing and then unpausing on a castle level would cause the noise channel to drop out of the music
- Fixed a bug where the mirroring on the fireball that some enemies throw wasn't initialized

#### Plus-exclusive changes
- Added the opening/ending text from the arcade version of the game
- Added a second emulated sound chip just for music (meaning that channels won't cut out to play sound effects)
- Music doesn't restart when warping within the same stage
- Music doesn't restart when pausing/unpausing the game
- The arcade version of the boss music is used instead of the console version
- The selected weapon is visible during gameplay, and you can change weapons without pausing
- Darutos gets drawn even when he's only partially visible, making him easier to see
- You can kill multiple enemies at once when they're on top of each other (makes dealing with Nyurus much less annoying)
- Fixed a bug where the orb you get at the end of a level wasn't animated correctly
- Fixed a bug where Nipata would get stuck if it spawned in a narrow gap

#### Arcade-exclusive changes
For a list of the all the changes I'm aware of between the console and arcade versions, see [here](https://www.infochunk.com/madoola/arcade.html). Here's a list of the changes between the real arcade version and the OpenMadoola version:
- The Plus changes (see above) are included
- Anything related to inserting coins isn't here. The continue system is the same as the other game types.
- There's enemy collision in the attract mode. I added a couple other stages besides Stage 1 to the attract mode to add some variety.
- Lucia starts with 3 lives instead of 2. This may have originally been a DIP switch though.
- Because OpenMadoola has start/select buttons, none of the control changes have been ported over.
- I didn't add the Stage 4 change because it seems like a mistake.
- I didn't add the camera change because I like the camera from the console version (which centers Lucia when she's on solid ground) more than the arcade version (which only moves up/down when Lucia is at the edge of the screen).
- The high score entry screen is made up because there's no public footage of it.
- There's no "hard mode" option for increased enemy damage.
- The game over screen doesn't play after you beat the game.
- Lucia can only use the fountain once per life, per stage. Otherwise you can get stay in a stage indefinitely and kill enemies over and over, which breaks the scoring system.
- All the default high scores are now 10x lower. In my opinion, the default high scores should be relatively easy to beat.

## Build Instructions

### UNIX-like platforms (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, etc)

Install GCC or Clang, make, cmake, and the SDL2 development libraries from your package manager.

Generate the build files with
```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Next, compile the executable with this command:
```
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Windows

Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/).

Download the latest SDL2 VC development version from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases). Unzip the file into libs\\SDL2, making sure that you go down a level so the top-level directories in the folder are docs\\ include\\ libs\\ etc.

Run cmake on the checked out source directory, then open the generated solution in Visual Studio.

Note that I don't check if the project builds with Visual Studio in between releases, so if you check out from master it's possible that the project won't build without changes. If you make a PR with the required changes, that would be appreciated.
